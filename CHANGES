v0.1.3:
+ all tracks: pressing all tracks again will return to previous group
- delete: fixed the dialog message when deleting a track (not a group track)
- group filter: enabling group filter now focuses the filter editline
- in groups menu: groups are now listed alphabetically
- id3v1: id3v1 reader fixed
+ merge: now allowed in groupmode (maybe it's confusing)
+ group delete: deleting a group doesn't reset the group filter
+ sort: sorting grouptracks by number is remembered between all tracks/groups switches (so switching back and forth between groups and all tracks doesn't screw up the ordering)
+ status: reworked the status line, now it provides some basic statistics about the tracks (counts and ratings)
- adding tracks to a group with the same tracks already present didn't work (it was impossible to make duplicities except through import)
+ detachcopy: make a copy of a track in a group (grouptrack) and replace the current link in the group with it
+ relink: change the grouptrack to link to some other similar track

- both tables: removed grid
+ filter: now doesn't reset automatically, theres a button and menu entry for it
+ filter: a history of last 20 filter rules is now available
